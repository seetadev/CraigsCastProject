### OpenRank APIs

OpenRank APIs enables the property agent to summarize and arrive at vital data points required to list a properties at Farcaster based on multiple parameters both global ranking and local context based rankings.
We are integrating OpenRank APIs with EtherCalc for Farcaster property listings: an example at https://ethercalc.net/veg1fcob7fe3
Different ranking parameter APIs lets the property agent organize the tasks based on multiple factors. Please visit demos at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1CCD1-evAAhV71Kys-nLdB7DAXXYSL_I0
Further, we can use OpenRankAPIs to create Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for service & maintenance providers and companies. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.
